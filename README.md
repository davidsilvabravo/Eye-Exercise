# Eye-Exercise
## Description
A pair of green eyes following your movements on the browser's window. Just for fun, whenever you want to play with it.

## How to run
You just need to download all these files from the repo, and put them together on a single folder:
- index.html
- ejes.js
- styles.css

Then, just open index.html on your browser and move your mouse and check that a pair of "eyes" follow mouse location.

## Roadmap of future improvements
No new additional improvements planned yet.
